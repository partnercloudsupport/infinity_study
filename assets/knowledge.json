          "description": "Soundness is about ensuring your program can’t get into certain invalid states. A sound type system means you can never get into a state where an expression evaluates to a value that doesn’t match the expression’s static type. For example, if an expression’s static type is String, at runtime you are guaranteed to only get a string when you evaluate it. Dart’s type system, like the type systems in Java and C#, is sound. It enforces that soundness using a combination of static checking (compile-time errors) and runtime checks. For example, assigning a String to int is a compile-time error. Casting an Object to a string using as String fails with a runtime error if the object isn’t a string.",

For example, if your app requires a user to log in, you can modify and hot reload a page several levels down in the navigation hierarchy, without re-entering your login credentials. State is kept, which is usually the desired behavior. If code changes affect the state of your app (or its dependencies), the data your app has to work with might not be fully consistent with the data it would have if it executed from scratch. The result might be different behavior after hot reload versus a hot restart. For example, if you modify a class definition from extending StatelessWidget to StatefulWidget (or the reverse), after hot reload the previous state of your app is preserved. However, the state might not be compatible with the new changes."

In Dart 2, those libraries’ Dart source code are turned into kernel files and sent to the mobile device’s Dart VM. The Dart VM re-loads all libraries from the new kernel file. So far no code is re-executed. The hot reload mechanism then causes the Flutter framework to trigger a rebuild/re-layout/repaint of all existing widgets and render objects."

Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed, secure application streaming service that allows you to stream desktop applications from AWS to any device running a web browser, without rewriting them. Amazon AppStream 2.0 provides you instant-on access to the applications you need, and a responsive, fluid user experience on the device of your choice. Users today want access to their applications from anywhere, using their preferred device. To support this, organizations need to maintain multiple versions of their desktop applications, and take additional measures to secure applications and data. While browser-based applications solve device compatibility and security problems for IT, the reality is that organizations still have many traditional desktop applications that need to be supported. Organizations face a choice: either rewrite their applications to run natively in browsers, which is time consuming and expensive, or continue to maintain and support a complex catalog of desktop applications. Amazon AppStream 2.0 gives you the benefits of native browser applications without the need to rewrite them. With Amazon AppStream 2.0, you can easily import your existing desktop applications to AWS and instantly start streaming them to an HTML5-compatible browser. You can maintain a single version of each of your apps, which makes application management easier. Your users always access the latest versions of their applications. Your applications run on AWS compute resources, and data is never stored on users’ devices, which means they always get a high-performance, secure experience. Unlike traditional on-premises solutions for desktop application streaming, Amazon AppStream 2.0 offers pay-as-you-go pricing, with no upfront investment and no infrastructure to maintain. You can scale instantly and globally, ensuring that your users always have the best possible experience."
